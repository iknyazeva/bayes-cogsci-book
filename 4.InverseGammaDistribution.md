# Inverse Gamma Distribution

The **Inverse Gamma distribution** is a continuous probability distribution often used as a **conjugate prior** for the variance of a normally distributed variable in Bayesian statistics. It is defined for positive real numbers and is the distribution of the inverse of a gamma-distributed random variable.

##  Probability Density Function (PDF)

The **Inverse Gamma distribution** with shape parameter $\alpha$ and scale parameter $\beta$ has the following probability density function (PDF):

$$
f(x \mid \alpha, \beta) = \frac{\beta^\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha)} x^{-\alpha - 1} \exp\left(-\frac{\beta}{x}\right)
$$

for $x > 0$ , where:
- $\alpha$ (shape parameter) controls the shape of the distribution.
- $\beta$ (scale parameter) controls the scale of the distribution.
- $\Gamma(\alpha)$ is the gamma function, which generalizes the factorial function.

##  Mean and Variance

For an inverse gamma distribution $X \sim \text{Inverse-Gamma}(\alpha, \beta)$, the mean and variance are:

- **Mean** (exists only for $\alpha > 1$:

  $$
  \mathbb{E}[X] = \frac{\beta}{\alpha - 1}
  $$

- **Variance** (exists only for $\alpha > 2$:

  $$
  \text{Var}(X) = \frac{\beta^2}{(\alpha - 1)^2 (\alpha - 2)}
  $$

## Usage in Bayesian Inference

The Inverse Gamma distribution is primarily used as a **prior distribution** for the **variance** $\sigma^2$ of a normal distribution in Bayesian inference. It is conjugate to the normal likelihood with unknown variance, meaning the posterior distribution of $\sigma^2$ remains an inverse gamma when the prior is inverse gamma. 

### When to Use the Inverse Gamma Distribution

The Inverse Gamma distribution is used in the following scenarios:

1. **Conjugate Prior for Variance**: 
   In Bayesian statistics, if we have data $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ that are normally distributed with an unknown variance $\sigma^2$, the **Inverse Gamma distribution** is often used as a conjugate prior for $\sigma^2$. This makes posterior inference easier.

2. **Modeling Uncertainty in Scale Parameters**:
   It is also used to model uncertainty in **scale parameters** (e.g., variances, rates) in hierarchical models or other Bayesian settings.

### Example in Bayesian Inference

Suppose we are modeling data from a normal distribution with unknown variance $\sigma^2$. The likelihood is:

$$
X_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)
$$

We place an **Inverse Gamma prior** on $\sigma^2$:

$$
\sigma^2 \sim \text{Inverse-Gamma}(\alpha, \beta)
$$

After observing data, the posterior distribution for $\sigma^2$ will also follow an inverse gamma distribution with updated parameters.

### Properties of the Inverse Gamma Distribution

- **Heavy-tailed**: The Inverse Gamma distribution is **heavy-tailed**, meaning it places non-negligible probability on very large values of the variance $\sigma^2$.
- **Non-negative Support**: The distribution is defined only for positive values, making it suitable for modeling variances and other scale parameters.

### Relationship to Gamma Distribution

If $X \sim \text{Inverse-Gamma}(\alpha, \beta)$, then $Y = \frac{1}{X}$ follows a **Gamma distribution** with parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$:

$$
Y \sim \text{Gamma}(\alpha, \beta)
$$

This connection is why the distribution is called **Inverse Gamma**.

## Conclusion

The Inverse Gamma distribution is a key tool in Bayesian statistics, particularly as a prior for unknown variances. Its conjugate properties simplify posterior inference and make it a natural choice in hierarchical modeling and other settings where variances need to be inferred.

	4)$𝑃(𝑋 \leq−2∩𝑋\geq 5)$
	
**Question 2.**

	1) The hours of service until all light bulbs in a batch of 5000 fail
	2) The number of failed lightbulbs in a batch of 5000 after 100 hours in service
	3) The probability of a light bulb failure before 100 hours in service
	4) The lifetime in hours of a particular lightbulb 

**Question 5.** 
If $𝑋∼Uniform(2,6)$, what is $𝑃(2<𝑋≤3)$? Round your answer to two decimal places 


**Question 6.** 
If $𝑋∼N(2,1)$  what is the expected value of $−5𝑋$ ? This is denoted as $𝐸(−5𝑋)$. 

**Question 7.** 
Let $𝑋∼N(1,1)$ and $𝑌∼N(4,32)$. What is the value of $𝐸(𝑋+𝑌)$ 

**Question 8.** 
The normal distribution is also linear in the sense that if $𝑋∼N(\mu,\sigma^2)$ , then for any real constants $a \neq 0$ and $b$, the distribution of $Y= aX+b$  is distributed $N(a\mu+b,a^2\sigma^2)$.

**Question 9.**  Which of the following random variables would yield the highest value of $𝑃(−1<𝑋<1)$
	  1) $𝑋∼N(0,0.1)$ 
	  2) $𝑋∼N(0,1)$
	  3) $X∼N(0,10)$
	  4) $𝑋∼N(0,100)$
  
**Question 10.** 
Which of the following (possibly more than one) must be true if random variable $𝑋$ is continuous with PDF $𝑓(𝑥)$ ?
	 - f(x) is an increasing function of 𝑥
	 - $\int_{-\inf}^{\inf}𝑓(𝑥)𝑑𝑥=1$
	 - $𝑓(𝑥)$  is a continuous function
	 - $𝑋\geq 0$ always
	 - $𝑓(𝑥)\geq 0$ always [+]
	 - $\lim_{x→\inf​}f(x)=\inf$
 
 **Question 11.** 
 If $𝑋∼Exp(3)$ what is the value of $𝑃(𝑋>1/3)$ ? Round your answer to two decimal places
 
 **Question 12.** 
Suppose $𝑋∼\text{Uniform}(0,2)$  and $𝑌\sim \text{Uniform}(8,10)$. What is the value of $𝐸(4𝑋+𝑌)$ 

**Question 13.** 
Suppose $𝑋∼N(1,52)$  and $𝑌\sim N(−2,32)$ and that $𝑋$ and $𝑌$ are independent. We have $𝑍=𝑋+𝑌∼N(\mu,\sigma^2)$  because the sum of normal random variables also follows a normal distribution.
	- What is the value of $\mu$? 
	- What is the value of $\sigma^2$ 

**Question 14.**  
if random variables $𝑋$ and $𝑌$ are not independent, we still have $𝐸(𝑋+𝑌)=𝐸(𝑋)+𝐸(𝑌)$, but now $𝑉𝑎𝑟(𝑋+𝑌)=𝑉𝑎𝑟(𝑋)+𝑉𝑎𝑟(𝑌)+ 2𝐶𝑜𝑣(𝑋,𝑌)$  where $𝐶𝑜𝑣(𝑋,𝑌)=𝐸[(𝑋−𝐸[𝑋])(𝑌−𝐸[𝑌])]$  is called the covariance between $𝑋$ and $𝑌$ .
A convenient formula for calculating variance was given in the supplementary material (from past lecture): $𝑉𝑎𝑟(𝑋)=𝐸[(𝑋−𝐸[𝑋])^2]=𝐸[𝑋^2]−(𝐸[𝑋])^2$ . Which of the following is an analogous expression for the covariance of $𝑋$ and $𝑌$?
	 1) $E[Y^2]−(E[Y])^2$
	 2) $𝐸[𝑋^2]−(𝐸[𝑋])^2+𝐸[𝑌^2]−(𝐸[𝑌])^2$
	 3) $(𝐸[𝑋^2]−(𝐸[𝑋])^2)⋅(𝐸[𝑌^2]−(𝐸[𝑌])^2)$
	 4) $𝐸(𝑋𝑌)−𝐸(𝑋)𝐸(𝑌)$

Consider again $𝑋∼N(1,52)$  and $𝑌∼N(−2,32)$ , but this time $𝑋$  and $𝑌$ are _not_ independent. Then $𝑍=𝑋+𝑌$ is still normally distributed with the same mean found in Question 13. What is the variance of $𝑍$ if $𝐸(𝑋𝑌)=−5E(XY)=−5$?

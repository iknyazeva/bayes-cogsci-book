# Quize (Probability)


**Question 1** 
The following arguments best demonstrate reasoning from which paradigm? Explain your choice.

>	You consider results from past elections, factoring in demographic changes as well as your colleague‚Äôs appeal in your community before concluding that she has a 3/4 chance of winning an upcoming election. 

>	You survey 100 dental patients and find that 43 have received a filling within the last year. You conclude that the probability of needing a filling in any given year is .43
>	

**Question 2** 
If you randomly guess on this question, you have a .25 probability of being correct. Which probabilistic paradigm  does this argument best demonstrate?

**Question 3**
On a multiple choice test, you do not know the answer to a question with three alternatives. One of the options, however, contains a keyword which the professor used disproportionately often during lecture. Rather than randomly guessing, you select the option containing the keyword, supposing you have a better than 1/3 chance of being correct. Which probabilistic paradigm does this argument best demonstrate?


**Question 4**
On average, one in three students at your school participates in extracurricular activities. You conclude that the probability that a randomly selected student from your school participates is 1/3. Which probabilistic paradigm  does this argument best demonstrate?


**Question 4**
Your friend offers a bet that she can beat you in a game of chess. If you win, she owes you $5, but if she wins, you owe her $3.

	- Suppose she is 100% confident that she will beat you. What is her  expected return for this game? 
	- Suppose she is only 50% confident that she will beat you (her personal probability of winning is ùëù=0.5). What is her expected return now? (Report your answer without the $ symbol.
	- Now assuming your friend will only agree to fair bets (expected return of $0), find her personal probability that she will win. Report your answer as a simplified fraction.

**Question 5**
Suppose your friend offers a pair of bets:

	(i) if it rains or is overcast tomorrow, you pay him $4, otherwise he pays you $6;

	(ii) if it is sunny you pay him $5, otherwise he pays you $5.

	- Suppose rain, overcast, and sunny are the only events in consideration. If you make both bets simultaneously, this is called a "Dutch book," as you are guaranteed to win money. How much do you win regardless of the outcome?

**Question 6** 
Dutch book. Apparently your friend doesn't understand the laws of probability. Let's examine the bets he offered. Why this game is Dutch book?

	1. For bet (i) to be fair, his probability that it rains or is overcast must be .6 (you can verify this by calculating his expected return and setting it equal to $0).
    
	2. For bet (ii) to be fair, his probability that it will be sunny must be .5.

# Bayesian Statistics for Cognitive Science: Course Overview

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Bayesian Statistics for Cognitive Science** course, designed to equip you with the tools and frameworks to analyze data and make informed decisions under uncertainty, with a focus on practical applications in cognitive studies. This course emphasizes Bayesian methods, which provide a flexible and intuitive approach to statistical modeling, particularly suited for the complex and often noisy data encountered in cognitive science experiments. Drawing inspiration from resources like [*Statistical Rethinking*](https://xcelab.net/rm/) by Richard McElreath   [*Bayesian Analysis with Python* ](https://aloctavodia.github.io/books.html) by Osvaldo Martin and [** Bayesian Statistics** (University of California, Santa Cruz)]
(https://www.coursera.org/learn/mcmc-bayesian-statistics) the course will guide you through theoretical foundations, practical implementations in Python using Jupyter Book, and real-world applications, including experiments conducted at the [**Institute for Cognitive Studies (IKI)**](https://ics.spbu.ru/).

The primary aim of this course is to enable you to apply Bayesian statistical methods to real-world cognitive science problems. Through a combination of theoretical lessons, hands-on coding exercises, and project-based learning, you will learn to formulate hypotheses, process data, build models, and interpret results in the context of cognitive experiments. Examples will include data from IKI experiments, ensuring relevance to cutting-edge research in cognitive science.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, you will be able to:
- Understand and apply Classical, Frequentist, and Bayesian probability frameworks to cognitive science problems.
- Use Python and tools like PyMC to implement Bayesian models, including MCMC simulations and hierarchical models.
- Analyze real-world cognitive science data, such as those from IKI experiments, to formulate and test research hypotheses.
- Build, evaluate, and interpret statistical models, including regression, ANOVA, and hierarchical models, in a Bayesian context.
- Complete a course project that demonstrates your ability to conduct a full Bayesian data analysis pipeline, from hypothesis formulation to drawing conclusions.

## Course Materials and Tools

The course is built using **Jupyter Book** to provide an interactive learning experience, with Python as the primary programming language. You will use libraries such as **PyMC** and **ArviZ** for Bayesian modeling and visualization. Key resources include:

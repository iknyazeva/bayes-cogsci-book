# Part 1. Probability Paradigms. 

How to Think About Probabilities  

Psychology often deals with uncertainty: Will a patient respond to therapy? Will a participant solve a puzzle? Will a test item trigger stress?  
Statistics gives us a language for talking about such uncertainty, and probability is the central tool. But what do we really mean when we talk about probability? And why are there different ways to define it?  

Let’s explore.

## Getting a Feel for Probability  

Some questions are straightforward:  

- *What’s the chance of rolling a four on a fair die?* → 1 out of 6.  
- *What’s the chance of drawing a red card from a shuffled deck?* → 1 out of 2.  

But in psychology, we usually face messier questions:  

- *What’s the probability a child with reading difficulties will improve after six months of training?*  
- *What’s the probability a therapy session gets cancelled?*  
- *How likely is it that one personality test is more reliable than another?*  

Notice how these questions feel different. Some are easy to imagine repeating over and over (like rolling dice). Others are about unique, one-time situations (like tomorrow’s therapy session). That’s where different probability frameworks come in.

## Three Main Frameworks  

1. **Classical (Games of Chance)**  
   Think of dice, cards, or roulette. If outcomes are equally likely, probability is just “favorable cases ÷ all cases.” Simple, but limited.  

2. **Frequentist (Long-Run Frequency)**  
   Here probability means “what happens if we repeat this experiment infinitely many times.”  
   - Example: if in 10,000 therapy appointments, 1,000 are cancelled, the probability of cancellation is 0.1.  

   Works well when repetition is possible (lots of patients, lots of trials). But harder for one-time or unique events:  
   - *What’s the probability it rains tomorrow?* We don’t have infinite “tomorrows.”  
   - *Is a test fair?* For frequentists, it’s either fair (probability 1) or not (probability 0). That feels odd, since psychologists often want a measure of *uncertainty* about fairness.  

3. **Bayesian (Degrees of Belief)**  
   Here probability is about your *uncertainty*, given what you know. It’s subjective but consistent. You start with prior knowledge, add new evidence, and update your belief.  
   - Example: you estimate the probability that your patient will relapse. You’ve read research (priors) and you’ve observed their progress so far (new evidence). Your estimate isn’t fixed—it changes as you learn more.

## Thinking About Bets  

A useful way to grasp Bayesian probability is to imagine bets.  

Suppose you want to express how likely it is that your client will show up tomorrow. If you think it’s about 80%, you should feel comfortable with a bet like:  

- Win \$4 if they show up, lose \$1 if they don’t.  
- Or the reverse: lose \$4 if they show up, win \$1 if they don’t.  

If both bets feel equally “fair,” you’re expressing a probability of 0.8.  

This “betting perspective” forces your numbers to be consistent. If your beliefs aren’t consistent (say, you assign contradictory probabilities to related events), someone could construct a set of bets that *guarantees you lose*. This is called a *Dutch book*.

## Why Psychologists Might Care  

- **Frequentist tools** dominate standard research (t-tests, ANOVAs, p-values).  
- **Bayesian reasoning** matches how humans often think in real life: we start with expectations, update with evidence, and stay flexible.  

For instance:  
- A clinician updates their belief about a diagnosis after each new symptom.  
- A researcher revises expectations about treatment efficacy as new studies accumulate.  
- A participant in a learning experiment updates their expectations trial by trial.  

Both perspectives are useful—frequentist methods for large samples and repeatable trials, Bayesian methods for unique events, prior knowledge, and evolving beliefs.

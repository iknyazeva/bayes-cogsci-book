# Bayes' Theorem and Conditional Probability  

Here we explore **conditional probability** and **Bayes' theorem**, foundational concepts in the Bayesian statistical framework. Bayes' theorem provides a way to **update beliefs based on new evidence**, making it a powerful tool in decision-making and probability analysis.

## 1. Conditional Probability  

Conditional probability describes the probability of an event $A$ given that another event $B$ has already occurred.  

**Definition:**  

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
$$  

where:  
- $P(A \cap B)$ = probability that both $A$ and $B$ occur  
- $P(B)$ = probability of $B$

### Example: Probability in a Classroom  

Suppose we have a class of 30 students:  
- 9 are female  
- 12 are computer science majors, 4 of whom are female  

1. Probability that a randomly selected student is female:  

$$
P(F) = \frac{9}{30} = \frac{3}{10}
$$  

2. Probability that a student is a computer science major:  

$$
P(CS) = \frac{12}{30} = \frac{2}{5}
$$  

3. Probability that a student is both female and a computer science major:  

$$
P(F \cap CS) = \frac{4}{30} = \frac{2}{15}
$$  

4. Conditional probability that a student is female **given** they are a CS major:  

$$
P(F|CS) = \frac{P(F \cap CS)}{P(CS)} 
= \frac{\tfrac{2}{15}}{\tfrac{2}{5}} 
= \frac{1}{3}
$$  

This makes sense: 4 of the 12 CS majors are female → $\tfrac{1}{3}$.

## 2. Independence  

Two events are **independent** if the occurrence of one does not affect the occurrence of the other.  

- Independence definition:  

$$
P(A|B) = P(A)
$$  

- Equivalent condition:  

$$
P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B)
$$  

**Check in our classroom example:**  

- $P(F|CS) = \tfrac{1}{3}$  
- $P(F) = \tfrac{3}{10}$  

Since $\tfrac{1}{3} \neq \tfrac{3}{10}$, **F and CS are not independent**.

## 3. Bayes' Theorem  

Bayes’ theorem lets us **reverse conditional probabilities**.  

**Formula:**  

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
$$  

Expanded version (law of total probability):  

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)}
$$  

---

### Example: Applying Bayes’ Theorem to Classroom Data  

We want: *Probability a student is a CS major given that they are female.*  

$$
P(CS|F) = \frac{P(F|CS) \cdot P(CS)}{P(F|CS) \cdot P(CS) + P(F|\neg CS) \cdot P(\neg CS)}
$$  

Plugging in numbers:  

- $P(F|CS) = \tfrac{1}{3}$  
- $P(CS) = \tfrac{2}{5}$  
- $P(F|\neg CS) = \tfrac{5}{18}$  
- $P(\neg CS) = \tfrac{3}{5}$  

$$
P(CS|F) = \frac{\tfrac{1}{3} \times \tfrac{2}{5}}{\tfrac{1}{3} \times \tfrac{2}{5} + \tfrac{5}{18} \times \tfrac{3}{5}}
= \frac{\tfrac{2}{15}}{\tfrac{2}{15} + \tfrac{5}{30}}
= \frac{4}{9}
$$  

Check with direct definition:  

$$
P(CS|F) = \frac{P(CS \cap F)}{P(F)} = \frac{\tfrac{4}{30}}{\tfrac{9}{30}} = \tfrac{4}{9}
$$  

✔ Same result.

## 4. Real-World Application: Medical Testing  

Bayes’ theorem is crucial in **diagnostic test interpretation**.  

Example: Early HIV test (ELISA):  
- Sensitivity (probability of positive test given HIV): $P(+|HIV) = 0.977$  
- Specificity (probability of negative test given no HIV): $P(-|\neg HIV) = 0.926$  
- Prevalence in population: $P(HIV) = 0.0026$  

We want: *Probability a person has HIV given a positive test.*  

Bayes’ theorem:  

$$
P(HIV|+) = \frac{P(+|HIV) \cdot P(HIV)}{P(+|HIV) \cdot P(HIV) + P(+|\neg HIV) \cdot P(\neg HIV)}
$$  

Plugging in:  

$$
P(HIV|+) = \frac{0.977 \cdot 0.0026}{0.977 \cdot 0.0026 + (1 - 0.926) \cdot (1 - 0.0026)}
$$  

$$
P(HIV|+) \approx 0.033
$$  

Despite high test accuracy, the **posterior probability** of actually having HIV given a positive test is only about **3.3%**, showing how **low prevalence strongly affects results**.

## 5. Conclusion  

- **Conditional probability**: probability of one event given another.  
- **Independence**: events don’t affect each other.  
- **Bayes’ theorem**: updates beliefs by reversing conditional probabilities.  

✅ Core idea: **Start with prior belief + new evidence → updated (posterior) belief.**  

This principle underlies much

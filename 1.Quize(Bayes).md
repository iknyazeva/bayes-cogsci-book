For all tasks you should provide the calculations along with the answer.

 **Titanik** 
For Questions 1-4, refer to the following table regarding passengers of the famous Titanic, which tragically sank on its maiden voyage in 1912. The table organizes passenger/crew counts according to the class of their ticket and whether they survived.


| is survived | 1st | 2d  | 3d  | Crew |
| ----------- | --- | --- | --- | ---- |
| yes         | 203 | 118 | 178 | 212  |
| no          | 122 | 167 | 528 | 673  |


**Question 1** If we randomly select a person's name from the complete list of passengers and crew, what is the probability that this person travelled in 1st class? Round your answer to two decimal places.


**Question 2**  What is the probability that a (randomly selected) person survived? Round your answer to two decimal places


**Question 3** What is the probability that a (randomly selected) person survived, given that they were in 1st class? Round your answer to two decimal places


**Question 4**  The events concerning class and survival are statistically independent. 
	
	[ ]True
	[ ]False

	
For Questions 5-9, use the following common task to practice conditional probability.

**Task Description:**

You have three bags labeled A, B, and C, each containing different quantities of red and blue marbles. The contents of each bag are as follows:

- **Bag A:** Contains 2 red marbles and 3 blue marbles.
- **Bag B:** Contains 5 red marbles and 1 blue marble.
- **Bag C:** Contains only 3 red marbles (no blue marbles).


**Question 5** If you select from bag B, what is the probability that you will draw a red marble? Express the exact answer as a simplified fraction? 



**Question 6** If you randomly select one of the three bags with equal probability (so that $𝑃(𝐴)=𝑃(𝐵)=𝑃(𝐶)=1/3$ and then randomly draw a marble from that bag, what is the probability that the marble will be blue? Round your answer to two decimal places.


**Question 7**  Suppose a bag is randomly selected (again, with equal probability), but you do not know which it is. You randomly draw a marble and observe that it is blue. What is the probability that the bag you selected this marble from is A? That is, find 𝑃(𝐴∣blue)P(A∣blue). Round your answer to two decimal places. 


**Question 8** Suppose a bag is randomly selected (again, with equal probability), but you do not know which it is. You randomly draw a marble and observe that it is blue. What is the probability that the bag you selected from is C? That is, find $𝑃(𝐶∣blue)$. Round your answer to two decimal places. 

**Question 9** Suppose a bag is randomly selected (again, with equal probability), but you do not know which it is. You randomly draw a marble and observe that it is red. What is the probability that the bag you selected from is C? That is, find $𝑃(𝐶∣red)$. Round your answer to two decimal places

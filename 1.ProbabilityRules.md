# Probability Background


## Rules of Probability  

Probabilities are defined for **events**. An event is some outcome that we could potentially observe, such as the result of rolling a fair six-sided die.

- Example: Let **A** be the event “rolling a 4.”  
  - Then $P(A) = \tfrac{1}{6}$.  
  - If we represent the die roll as the random variable $X$, then we can also write $P(X = 4) = \tfrac{1}{6}$.  

### Basic rules  

- Probabilities are always between zero and one:  

  $$
  0 \leq P(A) \leq 1
  $$

- The sum of probabilities over all possible events is one:  

  $$
  \sum_{i=1}^{6} P(X = i) = 1
  $$

- Complement: the probability of “not A” (denoted $A^c$) is:  

  $$
  P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)
  $$

- Union of two events:  

  $$
  P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)
  $$

- If $A_i$ for $i=1,\ldots,m$ are **mutually exclusive** (only one can happen), then:  

  $$
  P\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{m} A_i\right) = \sum_{i=1}^{m} P(A_i)
  $$



##  Odds  

Probabilities can also be expressed in terms of **odds**.  

For example, for event A = “rolling a 4”:  

$$
O(A) = \frac{P(A)}{P(A^c)} = \frac{P(A)}{1 - P(A)}
$$  

Substituting $P(A) = \tfrac{1}{6}$:  

$$
O(A) = \frac{\tfrac{1}{6}}{\tfrac{5}{6}} = \tfrac{1}{5}
$$  

This can be read as **1:5 odds** (or “5 to 1 against”).  

- Event with probability $\tfrac{3}{10}$ → odds = 3:7.  
- Event with probability $\tfrac{4}{5}$ → odds = 4:1.  

### From odds back to probability  

If an event has odds $a:b$, then:  

$$
\frac{P(B)}{1 - P(B)} = \frac{a}{b} \implies P(B) = \frac{a}{a+b}
$$  

Example: odds 2:5 → probability = $\tfrac{2}{7}$.

## Expectation  

The **expected value** of a random variable $X$ is a weighted average of its possible values, weighted by their probabilities.  

If $X$ can take values $x_1, \ldots, x_n$:  

$$
E(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \cdot P(X = x_i)
$$  

**Example:** fair six-sided die:  

$$
E(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{6} i \cdot \tfrac{1}{6} 
= \tfrac{1}{6}(1+2+3+4+5+6) 
= 3.5
$$  

Note: the die will never land on 3.5, but across many rolls the average outcome tends toward this number.

## Variance  

Expectation tells us the **average** value of a random variable, but it does not tell us how much values vary around that average. This is where **variance** comes in.  

Variance of $X$:  

$$
Var(X) = E\big[(X - E(X))^2\big]
$$  

This can also be written as:  

$$
Var(X) = E(X^2) - (E(X))^2
$$  

### Example: variance of a fair six-sided die  

1. First compute $E(X^2)$:  

$$
E(X^2) = \sum_{i=1}^{6} i^2 \cdot \tfrac{1}{6} 
= \tfrac{1}{6}(1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2)
= \tfrac{91}{6}
$$  

2. Recall $E(X) = 3.5$, so $(E(X))^2 = 12.25$.  

3. Thus:  

$$
Var(X) = \tfrac{91}{6} - 12.25 = \tfrac{35}{12} \approx 2.92
$$  

The **standard deviation** is the square root of variance:  

$$
SD(X) = \sqrt{Var(X)} \approx 1.71
$$  

So, while the expected value of the die is 3.5, the outcomes typically vary about ±1.7 around this mean.

✅ **Key idea:**  
- **Expectation** = average outcome.  
- **Variance** = how spread out the outcomes are around the average.
